%Based on the symmetric keys, \name{} %includes a secure key distribution mechanism that can resist to interference from adversaries. By leveraging the keys, it
\name{} samples packets and embeds cryptographic markings in the packets so as to verify packet source and forwarding paths, and achieve fault localization, which ensures accuracy and robustness of the protocol even in the presence of interference from adversaries. We prototype \name{} and use real experiments based on the prototype to demonstrate the performance of \name{}. The results show \name{} achieves around 99.5\% localization accuracy, and incurs small communication overhead, e.g., more than 90\% throughput and 85\% goodput compared to the baseline. %Besides, \name{} also makes both packet and routing entity lightweight with 6.03\% packet overhead and 3.23 MB router storage overhead.
We hope that the robustness properties of \name{} can become a fundamental primitive to construct highly secure and efficient data-plane protocols.
